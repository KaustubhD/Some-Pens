# Julia Set

An implementation of the Julia set. Read its [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)

## Directions

1. Uncover different variations of the Julia set by uncommenting the variable ```c``` one at a time.

2. There are two color schemes available
    * Colored ```hslColor()```,
    * Black and green ```blackGreen()```
  
  You will find the calls to respective functions in the code, if you need to change it.
